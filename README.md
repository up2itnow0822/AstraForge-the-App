# AstraForge: The Sovereign AI IDE

> **The first Integrated Development Environment where AI isn't just a copilot—it's your engineering team.**

AstraForge is a standalone, sovereign IDE built on Electron and React, designed to host a specialized panel of autonomous AI agents that debate, architect, and implement code changes through consensus.

## Core Features

### ⚡ 5-Agent Consensus Architecture
Unlike standard chat-bots, AstraForge orchestrates a team of five specialized agents:
1. **Nexus (Orchestrator)**: Manages the workflow.
2. **Vanguard (Security)**: Enaudits code for vulnerabilities.
3. **Prism (Product)**: Ensures user alignment.
4. **Helix (Systems)**: Architects robust patterns.
5. **Cipher (Implementation)**: Writes the actual code.

### ⚡ Consensus-Composer
A dedicated visual interface for reviewing, diffing, and applying complex multi-file changes generated by the agent swarm.

### ⚡ Sovereign & Private
Your code, your keys, your local environment. AstraForge is designed to run fully local or self-hosted.

## Installation

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)
Deploy the full environment instantly.

```bash
docker run -it -p 3000:3000 astraforge/ide
```

### Option 2: Desktop (Local Build)
Build the Electron application directly from source.

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Launch Development Environment
npm run dev

# Build binary
npm run dist
```

## Development Philosophy
We believe in **High-Agency AI**. Tools should handle the implementation details while humans direct the architectural intent. AstraForge is the realization of this 'Sovereign AI' vision.
