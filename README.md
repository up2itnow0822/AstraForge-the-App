# AstraForge: The Sovereign AI IDE

[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/1475549260140253194?label=Community&logo=discord&color=5865F2)](https://discord.gg/958AACqf7Y)


> **The first Integrated Development Environment where AI isn't just a copilot—it's your engineering team.**

AstraForge is a standalone, sovereign IDE built on Electron and React, designed to host a specialized panel of autonomous AI agents that debate, architect, and implement code changes through consensus.

> **Status (Feb 2026):** 10 bugs found and fixed in the Feb 2026 audit. Electron terminal wired via IPC/PTY — now fully functional in packaged app. 57 test suites, 188 tests — all passing. OpenRouter/Anthropic/OpenAI providers confirmed working end-to-end. See [`REPAIR_REPORT.md`](REPAIR_REPORT.md) for full details.

## Core Features

### ⚡ 5-Agent Consensus Architecture

Unlike standard chat-bots, AstraForge orchestrates a team of five specialized agents:

1. **Nexus (Orchestrator)**: Manages the workflow and proposes solutions.
2. **Vanguard (Security)**: Audits code for vulnerabilities and security risks.
3. **Prism (Product)**: Ensures user alignment and product value.
4. **Helix (AI Systems)**: Architects robust AI-native patterns.
5. **Cipher (Implementation)**: Writes the actual production code.

### ⚡ Consensus-Composer

A dedicated visual interface for reviewing, diffing, and applying complex multi-file changes generated by the agent swarm. Watch as your AI team debates, votes, and generates code in real-time.

### ⚡ Multi-Provider Support

Connect to your preferred LLM providers:
- **OpenAI** (GPT-4, GPT-4o, etc.)
- **Anthropic** (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Opus)
- **Grok** (xAI)
- **OpenRouter** (Access 100+ models)
- **Ollama** (100% Local, 100% Free)
- **LM-Studio** (Local models with OpenAI-compatible API)

### ⚡ Sovereign & Private

Your code, your keys, your local environment. AstraForge is designed to run fully local or self-hosted. No data leaves your machine unless you choose to use cloud APIs.

## Installation

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)

Deploy the full environment instantly.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/up2itnow0822/AstraForge-the-App.git
cd AstraForge-the-App

# Create your .env file
cp example.env .env
# Edit .env and add your API keys

# Build and run
docker compose up --build
```

Access the IDE at `http://localhost:3000`

### Option 2: Development Mode

Run directly from source for development.

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server (Vite + Electron)
npm run dev
```

### Option 3: Production Build

Build the Electron application for distribution.

```bash
# Build everything
npm run build

# Create distributable
npm run dist
```

## Configuration

### API Keys

Configure your LLM providers in the Settings modal (gear icon) or via environment variables:

```bash
# Global API Keys (in .env file)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
GROK_API_KEY=xai-...
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-...

# Local Models
OLLAMA_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:11434
OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3
```

### Agent-Specific Configuration

Each agent can be configured with a different provider and model via the "Models" tab in Settings.

## Usage

1. **Enter a Task**: Type your development task in the "New Task" box
2. **Generate**: Click "Generate" to start the AI debate process
3. **Watch the Debate**: Agents will propose, critique, and vote on solutions
4. **Review Changes**: Once consensus is reached, review generated code in the Composer
5. **Apply**: Click "Apply Changes to Disk" to write the files

## Development Philosophy

We believe in **High-Agency AI**. Tools should handle the implementation details while humans direct the architectural intent. AstraForge is the realization of this 'Sovereign AI' vision.

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

## Linting

```bash
# Check for issues
npm run lint

# Auto-fix issues
npm run lint:fix
```

## Status

**Current Version**: 1.0.0 (Alpha)

### ✅ What Works (Feb 2026 — Post-Terminal Fix)
- 5-agent consensus debate flow (Nexus, Vanguard, Prism, Helix, Cipher)
- All LLM providers: OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, Grok, Ollama, LM-Studio
- Synthesis → User Approval Gate → Code Generation pipeline
- Composer view: file diff, apply-to-disk
- Settings modal: per-agent provider/model/key config
- Connection testing (server/web mode)
- Server mode (Express + Socket.io): full-featured
- Electron mode: full debate flow, approval gate, code generation
- **Terminal (Electron) — FIXED:** XTerminal now spawns a real PTY via `node-pty` in the
  main process and streams I/O to the renderer through Electron IPC (`terminal:create`,
  `terminal:data`, `terminal:write`, `terminal:resize`, `terminal:exit`). Works in both
  packaged Electron builds and dev mode.

### ⚠️ Known Limitations
- **Agent hot-reload:** Changing provider/model in Settings requires app restart
- **Memory module:** Vector DB integration (LanceDB) is a dependency but not yet connected to the UI
- **Connection test (Electron):** Not available in packaged app; use web mode for testing

See [`REPAIR_REPORT.md`](REPAIR_REPORT.md) for the full audit and roadmap.

This is an alpha release. Core functionality is implemented and tested. Feedback and contributions welcome!
