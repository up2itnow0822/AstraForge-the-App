# Comprehensive Build Plan for AgentNexus

## Execution Strategy
The build proceeds in iterative phases that map to the AgentNexus lifecycle: foundation, intelligence enablement, and
mission-grade hardening. Each phase produces production-quality artifacts that unlock the subsequent stage while keeping
compliance, observability, and safety requirements in scope.

### Phase 1: Repository Foundation and Spec Alignment
- [ ] Task: Establish monorepo structure with `apps/`, `packages/`, `infrastructure/`, and `docs/` domains aligned to Spec Kit output.
- [ ] Task: Implement workspace tooling (pnpm workspaces, Turbo build graph, lint/test scripts) with CI pipeline via GitHub Actions.
- [ ] Task: Scaffold Mission Control Orchestrator service with NestJS HTTP API and PostgreSQL persistence.
- [ ] Task: Create Spec Kit Interpreter package with CLI entry points and validation harness wired to repository specs.
- [ ] Task: Configure Evidence Vault S3 bucket terraform module and migration scripts for SQL warehouse tables.
- [ ] Task: Author golden-path mission scenario and seed dataset for local simulation.
- [ ] Task: Integrate security scanning (npm audit, Trivy, Semgrep) gated in CI.
- [ ] Task: Deliver developer onboarding guide and environment bootstrap automation.
- [ ] Task: Stand up shared telemetry stack (OpenTelemetry collector, Prometheus, Grafana dashboards) in staging cluster.
- [ ] Task: Formalize contribution review checklist tied to AgentNexus governance.
- [ ] Task: Ship Phase 1 milestone retro with lessons learned and backlog adjustments.

### Phase 2: Intelligence Enablement and Agent Runtime
- [ ] Task: Implement Cognitive Workspace Runtime with task router, vector memory adapters, and sandboxed tool runners.
- [ ] Task: Integrate OpenAI Assistants and Hugging Face inference connectors with secure token exchange through Vault.
- [ ] Task: Deliver autonomous agent templates (researcher, planner, engineer, reviewer) with capability manifests.
- [ ] Task: Wire agent lifecycle events to Observability Pipeline and Mission Control dashboards.
- [ ] Task: Expand Evidence Vault ingestion flows for dataset provenance, artifact signatures, and QA reports.
- [ ] Task: Stand up Autonomous QA Engine service with Jest, fast-check, and chaos hooks triggered per mission stage.
- [ ] Task: Implement knowledge transfer workflows enabling cross-mission learning checkpoints.
- [ ] Task: Produce human-in-the-loop review console for mission oversight with real-time status streaming.
- [ ] Task: Harden authentication and authorization guardrails (fine-grained RBAC, audit log signing, OPA policy bundles).
- [ ] Task: Run end-to-end mission rehearsal exercising failure scenarios and escalation policies.

### Phase 3: Mission-Grade Hardening and Launch Readiness
- [ ] Task: Formalize GitOps deployment workflows with Argo CD, progressive delivery, and mission rollback runbooks.
- [ ] Task: Implement disaster recovery playbooks including mission replay buffers and cross-region replication.
- [ ] Task: Operationalize cost and energy telemetry with automated guardrails for GPU workloads.
- [ ] Task: Launch public API documentation, SDKs, and sandbox mission catalogue.
- [ ] Task: Integrate third-party audit trail exports and SOC 2 evidence automation.
- [ ] Task: Finalize security chaos engineering regimen with continuous red-team simulations.
- [ ] Task: Conduct performance benchmarking for mission throughput, agent convergence, and QA coverage.
- [ ] Task: Deliver launch readiness review with checklists, sign-offs, and incident response training.
- [ ] Task: Transition to steady-state operations with post-launch monitoring SLOs and escalation handbooks.
- [ ] Task: Publish innovation roadmap for recursive self-improvement initiatives.

## Risk Management
- Maintain dependency hygiene through Renovate bot automation and vulnerability burn-down meetings.
- Enforce spec drift detection by diffing missions against authoritative documents every pull request.
- Conduct privacy impact assessments for all datasets, gating promotions on compliance approvals.
- Ensure fallback pathways for external integrations with service-level contracts and active monitoring.
- Capture risk burndown metrics per phase and present to governance board weekly.

## Validation Strategy
- Unit, integration, and property-based tests automated per package with coverage thresholds > 85%.
- Scenario simulations executed nightly across mission templates with synthetic adversarial agents.
- Continuous verification pipeline measuring mission success rate, regression deltas, and user experience SLIs.
- Manual governance reviews before mission types graduate from sandbox to production tiers.
- Final go/no-go validation requiring signed Evidence Vault artifacts, security approvals, and operations sign-off.
